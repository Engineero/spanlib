- **PCA** for extracting dominant spatial pattern of variability.
- **SSA/MSSA** which is like PCA but for extracting spatio-temporal patterns.
- **Joined SVD** which is like PCA but for extracting the common variability of two variables (using cross-covariances).
- **SVD model** deduce a predictand from a predictor using SVD.
- Full missing value support.
.. - PCA analysis can be **weighted** at each channel.
- **Switch of space and time** for PCA analyses performed on a large number of channels.
- For analysis, empirical orthogonal functions (**EOFs**), principal componants (**PCs**), expansion coefficient (**ECs**) and **reconstructions** of signal are available.
- Analyses can be performed on **several variables**  at the same time, with normalisation coefficents [python].
- **Pre-PCA** analysis to reduct the d-o-f before analysing huge datasets with MSSA or SVD.
- Monte-Carlo test for (M)SSA (**MC-SSA**).
- Full **CDAT** support [python].
